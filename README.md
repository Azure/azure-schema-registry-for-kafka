<h1>Azure Schema Registry for Kafka [Private Preview]</h1> 

Azure Schema Registry is a hosted schema repository service provided by Azure Event Hubs, designed to simplify schema management and data governance.

Azure Schema Registry provides:
- Schema versioning and evolution
- Kafka and AMQP client plugins for serialization and deserialization
- Role-based access control for schemas and schema groups

An overview of Azure Schema Registry can be found on the [Event Hubs docs page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/schema-registry-overview). 

Sample code can be found in implementation level folders (e.g. [avro](csharp/avro/samples))
